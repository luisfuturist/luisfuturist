# Luis Emidio

I am the lead developer and founder at [Gaia](https://github.com/9aia), where I focus on creating experimental projects with emerging technologies like GenAI, while also teaching English privately. Currently, I’m pursuing an undergraduate degree in AI at [FIAP](https://github.com/fiap) to complement my self-taught expertise. In my personal life, I’m deeply fascinated by philosophy and the future, and I express myself through AI by creatively expanding my favorite genre—cyberpunk—through art, [songs](https://suno.com/profile/luisfuturist), and other creative projects.
